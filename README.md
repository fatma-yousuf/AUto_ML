### What is the Automated ML?
#### - Automated Machine Learning, also referred to as Automated ML or AutoML, is an emerging technology to automate machine learning tasks, accelerate the model-building process, help data scientists focus on higher value-added duties, and improve the accuracy of ML models.
#### - AutoML is trying to automate parts of the data science workflow and drive data driven decision making.
#### - Basically, automated machine learning is an automated practice of selecting the model algorithm, hyperparameter optimization, modeling by iterations, and model evaluation.
